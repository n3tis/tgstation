My name is Oranges. I have a tragic story to tell. I am a developer for the /tg/station code on github. One day when I was over at MrStonedOne's house at 22198 Saint Seattle Washington 98115.
He said he was going shopping for weed and disappeared, while he was gone, I removed virology from the codebase because my catgirl harem was complaining about it. When I was done and made the PR, suddenly I got a DM from an unknown Discord user. The discord user had a gore profile picture of a black man with his brains leaking. The discord message said "Why did you do it?", at first I thought it was a troll, I responded that it was for balance reasons. He began a call with me and then read out my full name and the address of the contributors of tgstation and the SSNs. I had shit my pants by at this point but then suddenly I got sucked into the computer and then appeared in the middle of some random forest. It was midnight, I had no idea where I was, suddenly a mysterious bald man appeared smoking a fat blunt. He looked like MSO. "Kyle, is that you?" I said, he had hyper-realistic eyes and carried a laptop in his hands.
